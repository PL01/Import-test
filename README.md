# Import-test
Learning how to import files in python. 

test.py has the functions and variables needed. You input a number, and the number is converted from a string into an integer type. The integer is then passed into two functions because it is a global variable. One function serves to calculate a circumference of a circle, and the other serves to calculate the area of a circle.

There is also a random x variable with the value of 5. 

anothertest.py imports the math module and test.py. It prints a statement that calls the circumference() and area() functions. They're converted into string types, and I also print the x variable. 

Note: They're both in the same directory.
